# Transformer-Based Text Classification with AG News Dataset using BERT

This project implements a transformer model for text classification using the AG News dataset. The goal is to classify news articles into four categories: **World**, **Sports**, **Business**, and **Sci/Tech**, leveraging the power of transformer architectures for natural language processing tasks.

## Features  
- Implements a transformer-based architecture for text classification.  
- Utilizes the AG News dataset, available through **torchtext** and **Kaggle**, for training and evaluation.  
- Provides metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall** for performance evaluation.  
- Includes optional experiments with hyperparameter tuning and visualizations of model performance trends.

## Dataset  
- **Source:** AG News dataset  
- **Categories:**  
  - World  
  - Sports  
  - Business  
  - Sci/Tech  
- **Description:** Labeled text samples are divided into training and test sets for model training and evaluation.

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Loading:**  
   - Preprocess and load the AG News dataset using `torchtext` or Kaggle.  
2. **Model Architecture:**  
   - Design and implement a transformer model tailored for text classification.  
3. **Training and Validation:**  
   - Train the model on the labeled data and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.  
4. **Testing:**  
   - Evaluate the model on a held-out test set and measure metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.  
5. **Visualization (Optional):**  
   - Plot training/validation loss and accuracy across epochs to track model performance.

## Results  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Accuracy, precision, and recall are reported for performance analysis across categories.  
- **Optional Enhancements:**  
  - Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and other hyperparameters to improve results.  
  - Visualizations help illustrate trends and convergence behavior.
